				<h2>Repealing net neutrality will hurt conservatives</h2>
				<p>
					Net neutrality ensures that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can't block,
					censor or throttle traffic to websites. Without net neutrality, Comcast could
					legally slow down traffic to conservative sites and speed up traffic to its own
					news websites, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC">like MSNBC</a>.
					Verizon could be pressured to
					<a href="http://www.guns.com/2017/12/13/why-second-amendment-advocates-should-support-net-neutrality/">restrict people</a>
					from visiting websites that promote guns or sell guns in order to be politically correct.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's not just the ISPs, either. Killing net neutrality will give big Silicon
					Valley companies even MORE POWER to
					<a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/media/303295-how-facebook-twitter-are-systematically-silencing-conservative">silence conservative voices</a>, 
					and promote their 
					<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nearly-all-of-silicon-valleys-political-dollars-are-going-to-hillary-clinton/">political agendas</a>. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks and a vocal supporter of Donald Trump, warned the White House of this very possibility:
				</p>
				<p class="tweet">

				</p>

				<h2>Will they really do this?</h2>
				<p>
					Well, they've done it before ... over and over again. The term "net
					neutrality" was actually first used to discuss protecting Americans after
					<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/guide-net-neutrality/">Comcast banned users</a> 
					from protecting their own online privacy and AT&T prevented customers from using their own wi-fi routers. 
					Since then, Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile colluded with Google to 
					<a href="https://www.savetheinternet.com/blog/11/07/06/verizons-illegal-app-blocking">block innovative apps</a> 
					 &mdash; such as wireless tethering and "hotspot" apps &mdash; from entering the marketplace.
					And what about the time
					<a href="http://fortune.com/2009/04/03/group-asks-fcc-to-probe-iphone-skype-restrictions/">AT&amp;T schemed with Apple</a> 
					to restrict access to Skype? Or when all five major ISPs actually 
					<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/22/major-internet-providers-slowing-traffic-speeds">slowed down</a>
					 75% of all internet traffic?
				</p>
				<p>
					The FCC’s repeal of net neutrality hasn’t even officially gone into effect yet
					and &mdash; surprise, surprise! &mdash; AT&amp;T has already rolled out a 
					<a href="https://www.att.com/att/sponsoreddata/en/index.html">"sponsored data plan"</a>.
					This is what they're advertising on their website:
				</p>
				<p class="full-img">
					<img src="images/tread_sponsored.jpg" alt="Protecting voices" />
				</p>
				<p>
					And what about those big Silicon Valley companies?
					<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/01/29/facebook-cracks-down-on-gun-sales/79543652/">Facebook</a>
					 doesn't want private individuals to buy and sell guns.
					<a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/25744/bombshell-report-twitter-admits-censoring-ryan-saavedra">Twitter</a>
					 shadow-bans users for supporting Donald Trump.
					<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/03/01/the-purge-youtube-mass-censors-conservatives-new-right-classical-liberals/">YouTube</a>
					 has purged conservative videos.
					This censorship is being perpetrated by the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/google-facebook-twitter-censorship-europe-commission-hate-speech-propaganda-terrorist/">biggest players</a>
					 in social media.  Repealing net neutrality will give these companies 
					even more power to censor anything deemed “offensive” and will prevent 
					new companies from competing with them ... which is exactly why they've
					<a href=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/netflix-google-net-neutrality/548768/">stayed silent</a>
					during this process.
				</p>

				<h2>So what? The free market will sort things out.</h2>
				<p>
					That would be the case … if ISPs operated in a free market. Unfortunately, for
					years ISPs have leveraged their political influence &ndash particularly with Democrats &ndash
					in order to carve up the country into local and regional monopolies and duopolies, 
					driving up prices for everyday Americans while providing us with slow internet
					driving up prices for everyday Americans while providing us with slow internet
					speeds and terrible customer service. Did you know that over 50 million American households have 
					<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/50-million-us-homes-have-only-one-25mbps-internet-provider-or-none-at-all/">no choice</a>
					for their ISP?  
				</p>
				<p>
					The green areas of this map show where customers have only one option:
				</p>
				<p class="full-img">
					<img src="images/tread_map.png" alt="Protecting voices" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Does that look like freedom of choice? Or does it look like ISPs spending over a hundred million dollars
					<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16746230/net-neutrality-fcc-isp-congress-campaign-contribution">lobbying Washington</a>
					to protect their companies from competition?
				</p>

				<h2>But net neutrality is heavy-handed Obama-era regulations!</h2>
				<p>
					WRONG. Mainstream media outlets constantly give Obama credit for net neutrality
					protections. But net neutrality was not “invented” by the Democratic party in 
					2015. In fact, it has been supported by previous 
					<a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf">Republican FCC leadership</a>, 
					conservative Supreme Court Justice 
					<a href="https://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/06/14/scalia-was-right-after-all-about-net-neutrality/">Antonin Scalia</a>, 
					groups like the 
					<a href="http://www.cc.org/get_facts_about_net_neutrality">Christian Coalition</a>, 
					and thousands of small businesses, startups, and entrepreneurs. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The idea of net neutrality itself has literally been around since the internet was invented. 
					Just look at what Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the internet, has to say about it:
				</p>
				<p class="tweet">
					<img src="images/tread_lee.png" alt="Protecting voices" />
				</p>
				<p>
					The only reason the FCC enacted net neutrality regulations in 2015 is because
					Verizon's lawyers successfully sued the FCC, removing previous protections and 
					allowing them to 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_(2014)">block and discriminate</a>
					online content.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's true that net neutrality is a regulation. But the ISPs' studies claiming that it hurts investment and innovation have been 
					<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/insights/does-net-neutrality-stifle-investment-and-innovation/">debunked</a>.
					Net neutrality 
					<a href="https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-small-businesses-stand-to-lose-in-a-net-neutrality-rollback">protects the free market</a>
					by preventing ISPs from picking winners and losers. And it ensures that NOBODY
					can restrict your freedom of speech on the internet ... not even the government. 
					Because without net neutrality, they WILL tell you what you 
					<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/03/20-porn-unblocking-fee-could-hit-internet-users-if-state-bill-becomes-law/">can and can't do</a> 
					 online.
				</p>

				<h2>Bottom line: Don't let government bureaucrats steal your internet freedom</h2>
				<p>
					The fact of the matter is that
					<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/353285485/Freedman-Consulting-Net-Neutrality-Poll">83% of all Americans </a>,
					support net neutrality, including 73% of Republicans and 76% of Independents. 
					No one wants their cable company to control where they can get their online news from, 
					how they watch videos and listen to music, and what websites they can visit. Several 
					brave Republican lawmakers have started speaking out against the establishment line and
					criticized the FCC’s decision to screw over consumers in a handout to the ISPs. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Ajit Pai, the Chairman of the FCC,
					<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171005/09400638350/anybody-claiming-net-neutrality-rules-killed-broadband-investment-is-lying-to-you.shtml">lied</a>
					 about his reasons for killing net neutrality and 
					<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/why-the-fcc-ignored-public-opinion-in-its-push-to-kill-net-neutrality/">ignored</a>
					 comments from millions of Americans.
					He even undermined States' rights by forbidding us from enacting our own laws.
					Why would he do that? Hm...

					Congress works for you! So make them actually do their job for once. Tell them
					that you support net neutrality, and they damn well better support net
					neutrality, too.
