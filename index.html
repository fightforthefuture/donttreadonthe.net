		<h1>Net neutrality PROTECTS conservative voices on the internet</h1>
		<img src="images/conservative_s1.png" alt="Protecting voices" />
		<p>
			Net neutrality is the basic technological principle that has guided the
			Internet since the beginning. It prevents government-friendly monopolies from
			abusing their gatekeeper power, and makes the Internet a powerful platform for
			economic innovation, free speech, and the free exchange of ideas. It has helped
			conservative websites like Breitbart and Infowars find an audience, and it has
			protected them from politically-motivated censorship.
		</p>

	<div>
		<h2>Sign the petition to Republican lawmakers:</h2>
		<p>
			Killing net neutrality will silence conservative voices online. Protect
			freedom on the internet. Protect net neutrality.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>How will repealing net neutrality hurt conservatives?</h2>
		<p>
			Net neutrality ensures that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can't block,
			censor or throttle traffic to websites. Without net neutrality, Comcast could
			legally slow down traffic to conservative sites and speed up traffic to its own
			news websites, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC">like MSNBC</a>.
			Verizon could legally
			<a href="http://www.guns.com/2017/12/13/why-second-amendment-advocates-should-support-net-neutrality/">restrict people from websites that promote guns or sell guns online</a>
			to be politically correct.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's not just the ISPs, either. Killing net neutrality will give big Silicon
			Valley companies even MORE POWER to silence conservative voices.

		<h2>Okay, they "could." But what makes you think they will?</h2>
		<p>
			Because they've done it over and over and over again. The term "net
			neutrality" was actually first used to discuss protecting Americans after
			<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/guide-net-neutrality/">
			Comcast banned users from protecting their own online privacy and AT&T
			prevented customers from using their own wi-fi
			routers</a>. And that was just
			the beginning. Since then, Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile colluded with Google to
			<a href="https://www.savetheinternet.com/blog/11/07/06/verizons-illegal-app-blocking">block innovative apps from entering the marketplace</a>.
			And what about the time
			<a href="http://fortune.com/2009/04/03/group-asks-fcc-to-probe-iphone-skype-restrictions/">AT&amp;T schemed with Apple to restrict access to Skype</a>?
			Or when
			<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/22/major-internet-providers-slowing-traffic-speeds">all five major ISPs actually slowed down 75% of all internet traffic</a>?
			The FCC’s repeal of net neutrality hasn’t even officially gone into effect yet
			and &mdash; surprise, surprise! &mdash; 
			<a href="https://www.att.com/att/sponsoreddata/en/index.html">AT&amp;T has already rolled out "sponsored data plan"</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			And what about those big Silicon Valley companies?
			<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/01/29/facebook-cracks-down-on-gun-sales/79543652/">Facebook doesn't want private individuals to buy and sell guns</a>.
			<a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/25744/bombshell-report-twitter-admits-censoring-ryan-saavedra">Twitter shadow-bans users for supporting Donald Trump</a>.
			<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/03/01/the-purge-youtube-mass-censors-conservatives-new-right-classical-liberals/">YouTube has purged conservative videos</a>.
			<a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/419619-newsweek-retracted-franken-bots/">Medium deleted conservative accounts based on an article so fake that Newsweek had to retract it</a>.
			This <a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/419961-google-twitter-facebook-censor-voices/">censorship is being perpetrated by the biggest players in social media</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Is it any surprise that they've all quietly supported the repeal of net
			neutrality? What do you think they'll do with even MORE control over the
			internet?

		<h2>So what? The free market will sort things out.</h2>
		<p>
			That would be the case… if ISPs operated in a free market. Unfortunately, for
			years ISPs have operated in local and regional monopolies and duopolies,
			driving up prices for everyday Americans while providing us with slow internet
			speeds and terrible customer service. Did you know that 
			<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/50-million-us-homes-have-only-one-25mbps-internet-provider-or-none-at-all/">over 50 million American households have no choice for their ISP</a>?
			I'm in one of them… are you?
		</p>
		<p>
			The green areas of this map show where customers have only one option:
		</p>
		<img src="images/conservative_s5.png" alt="Protecting voices" />

		<p>
			Does that look like freedom of choice? Because to me, it looks like the result
			of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16746230/net-neutrality-fcc-isp-congress-campaign-contribution">ISPs spending $101,000,000 "lobbying" politicians to protect their companies from competition</a>.
		</p>

	<div>
		<h2>But net neutrality is heavy-handed Obama-era regulations!</h2>
		<p>
			WRONG. Mainstream media outlets constantly give Obama credit for net neutrality
			protections. But the 
			<a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf">Republican-led FCC actually adopted net neutrality as a policy under George W. Bush in 2005</a>,
			and millions of people across the political spectrum have been fighting for it
			ever since. The idea of net neutrality has literally been around since the
			internet was invented.
		</p>
		<img src="images/conservative_s6.png" alt="Protecting voices" />
		<p>
			It's true that net neutrality is a regulation. But the ISPs' 
			<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/insights/does-net-neutrality-stifle-investment-and-innovation/">studies claiming that it hurts investment and innovation have been debunked</a>.
			<a href="https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-small-businesses-stand-to-lose-in-a-net-neutrality-rollback">Net neutrality protects the free market</a>
			by preventing ISPs from picking winners and losers. And it ensures that NOBODY
			can restrict your freedom of speech on the internet. Because
			<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/03/20-porn-unblocking-fee-could-hit-internet-users-if-state-bill-becomes-law/">without net neutrality, the government WILL tell you what you can and can't do online</a>.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Bottom line: Don't let government bureaucrats steal your internet freedom</h2>
		<p>
			The fact of the matter is that
			<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/353285485/Freedman-Consulting-Net-Neutrality-Poll">77% of all Americans support keeping net neutrality</a>,
			including 73% of Republicans and 76% of Independents. We know what's best for
			us, so why is the FCC trying to shove these changes down our throats?
		</p>
		<p>
			Ajit Pai, the Chairman of the FCC,
			<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171005/09400638350/anybody-claiming-net-neutrality-rules-killed-broadband-investment-is-lying-to-you.shtml">lied about his reasons for killing net neutrality</a>
			and 
			<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/why-the-fcc-ignored-public-opinion-in-its-push-to-kill-net-neutrality/">ignored comments from millions of Americans</a>.
			He even undermined States' rights by forbidding us from enacting our own laws.
			Why would he do that? Hm...
		</p>
		<img src="images/conservative_s7.png" alt="Protecting voices" />
		<p>
			Congress works for you! So make them actually do their job for once. Tell them
			that you support net neutrality, and they damn well better support net
			neutrality, too.
